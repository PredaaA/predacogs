It will only works with InfluxDB v2 instances. Make sure to have an instance running, all commands to connect to your instance are in `[p]timeseriesset` group command.\nFor now you are on your own when installing this cog, I wrote a guide to install InfluxDB with Docker and Docker Compose here: https://github.com/PredaaA/predacogs/blob/dev/timeseries/README.md. Or here is the official docs: https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/get-started/.",
