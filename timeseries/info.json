It will only works with InfluxDB v2 instances. Make sure to have an instance running, all commands to connect to your instance are in `[p]timeseriesset` group command.\nFor now you are on your own when installing this cog, I don't provide any guide to setup InfluxDB, but it will come later, which is why it is on that branch.",
